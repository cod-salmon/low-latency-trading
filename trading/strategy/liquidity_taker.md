# The LiquidityTaker class
While the MarketMaker sends passive orders to the order book, the LiquidityTaker executes trade events by sending aggressive orders that trade against liquidity resting in the book. Therefore, while the `MarketMaker::onOrderBookUpdate` is developed and  `MarketMaker::onTradeUpdate` is left empty, `LiquidityTaker::onOrderBookUpdate`is left empty while `LiquidityTaker::onTradeUpdate` is developed:

### `LiquidityTaker::onTradeUpdate`
Very similar to `MarketMaker::LiquidityTaker`  but instead of looking at the fair or market price for reference, we look at the `agg_qty_ratio`. This is computed as the `market_update`'s `qty` to the `bbo`'s bid/ask `qty`. When this ratio is greater than or equal to `threshold`, it is an aggressive trade (we are selling/buying much more than the best existing sell/buy quantity). Therefore, we execute the trade. 
- If the market update is of `Side::BUY`, then we call `OrderManager::moveOrders` to buy a `clip` amount of passive orders at `bbo`'s `ask_price_` and sell a `clip` amount of passive orders at `Price_INVALID` (effectively, perform no sales).
- If the market update is of `Side::SELL`, then we call `OrderManager::moveOrders` to buy `clip` amount of passive orders at `Price_INVALID` and sell a `clip` amount of passive orders at `bbo`'s `bid_price_` .
